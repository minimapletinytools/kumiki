"""Where a distance attaches, at both ends.

A property of the PAIR and the plane rather than of either feature alone. An
anchor chosen per feature cannot know where the sensible attachment point is for
a given pair: two parallel edges each anchoring at their own midpoint gave a
dimension that leaned whenever those midpoints were offset along their length,
and a number beside it that was neither its length nor its direction.
